- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @brein5
- Iâ€™m interested in experimenting with sensors and motion feedback...
- These days Iâ€™m a mechanical engineer by profession, but I did learn some electronics when I was in university. 
In my spare time, I have been learning how to use the MPU9250 sensor with AVR microcontrollers!
